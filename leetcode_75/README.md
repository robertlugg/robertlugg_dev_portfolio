# LeetCode 75
This repository contains my solutions to the **LeetCode 75** coding problems, which are a curated set of essential questions commonly used in technical interviews.

## Problem List:
The list of problems follows the official [LeetCode 75 Study Plan](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/), designed to cover fundamental topics such as arrays, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.

## Introduction
The "Blind 75" LeetCode problems are a refined list of 75 key coding interview questions, popularized by Yangshun Tay, a software engineer. This list is widely recognized as one of the most efficient ways to prepare for technical interviews at top companies.

These problems cover a wide range of core concepts, focusing on **quality over quantity**. Completing these problems effectively prepares candidates for interviews at companies like Google, Facebook, and other leading tech firms.

For more details, see this guide on [Mastering the Blind 75](https://algocademy.com/blog/mastering-the-blind-75-your-ultimate-guide-to-leetcode-success).

## My Approach
The goal of this repository is to showcase my ability to work through these representative coding challenges and demonstrate my problem-solving skills to potential employers.

While solutions to these problems are readily available online, the code here is entirely **my own**. In cases where I was stuck, I sought guidance but ensured the implementation and understanding were mine. Resources I used for learning and refining include:
- **LeetCode.com**: I utilized their test cases to verify my solutions and catch edge cases.
- **YouTube.com**: Walkthrough videos provided insights into problem-solving strategies, but I avoided copying exact implementations.
- **ChatGPT**: I used ChatGPT as a mentor to critique and refine my code. After solving each problem, I asked for feedback and incorporated suggestions for improving efficiency and readability.

This process has not only strengthened my problem-solving abilities but also honed my ability to analyze and refactor code for improvement. I understand that in interviews, I won’t have access to these resources, and that’s fine — these exercises have prepared me for live problem-solving.

## How to Run

Each Python file is a stand-alone program and can be run using:
```bash
uv run leet_123_example.py
```
The requirements for running the code are minimal. If you'd like to recreate my environment, follow the steps below:

### Rebuild Environment
1. Install the `uv` package manager if it's not already installed:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
2. Install the required dependencies by running a dummy python file to trigger package install
```bash
uv run placeholder.py
```
3. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Conclusion
By working through this curated list of problems, I have gained a deeper understanding of common coding patterns and problem-solving strategies. I’m confident that this preparation equips me to excel in technical interviews and live coding sessions.
